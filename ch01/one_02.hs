-- Show that sum [x] = x for any number x

-- Not sure what the books expects as an answer here since
-- it gave a pretty precise definition of how the sum function
-- works in the chapter.  

-- If you were to call sum with one value x then the function would
-- add 1 to whatever else is in the list. In the case that the list
-- is a singleton then the only other 'value' is and empty list, the sum
-- of which is defined as 0. The answer will then be x + 0 or simply x
-- for any x.
